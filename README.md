# MSF-TCMA

## Abstract

This is the source code for paper "_Temporal Downscaling Meteorological Variables to Unseen Moments: Continuous Temporal Downscaling via Multi-Source Spatial-Temporal-Wavelet Feature Fusion and Time-Continuous Manifold_", which is in minor revise stage of "_ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing_"

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
